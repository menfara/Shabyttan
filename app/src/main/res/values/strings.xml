    <string name="art_info">This painting depicts Monet\'s first wife, Camille, outside on a snowy day passing by the French doors of their home at Argenteuil. \n\nHer face is rendered in a radically bold Impressionist technique of mere daubs of paint quickly applied, just as the snow and trees are defined by broad, broken strokes of pure white and green.</string>
